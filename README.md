# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection: A Multi-Tiered Analytical Approach

A comprehensive **data science project** integrating **Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive Analytics** to improve heart disease detection and clinical decision-making.

---

## Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, responsible for approximately **17.9 million deaths annually**.  
This project addresses the limitations of manual diagnosis by implementing a **data-driven analytical framework**:

### Diagnostic Analytics
- Investigates historical correlations
- Identifies key clinical indicators using statistical hypothesis testing

### Predictive Analytics
- Develops machine learning models to predict patient risk
- Prioritizes **minimizing False Negatives** by maximizing **Recall**

### Prescriptive Analytics
- Translates model outputs into **actionable clinical strategies**
- Supports early intervention and decision-making

**Primary Outcome:**  
A robust detection system achieving **91.15% Recall** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.

- **StandardScaler** for numerical feature normalization

### 4️⃣ Modeling & Evaluation
- Models evaluated using **5-Fold Cross Validation**
- Algorithms tested:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - XGBoost
- Primary optimization metric: **Recall**

## Key Insights

### Dominant Clinical Factors
- **ST_Slope**, **ChestPainType**, and **ExerciseAngina** show strong statistical significance
- **Flat** or **Down ST Slope** is a critical risk indicator

### Physiological Indicators
- Patients with heart disease tend to have:
  - **Lower MaxHR**
  - **Higher Oldpeak values**

### Metabolic Correlation
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia)** significantly contributes to cardiovascular risk

---

## Prescriptive Recommendations

Based on the analytical findings, the following strategies are proposed:

### Priority Triage Protocol
- Patients with:
  - **Asymptomatic (ASY) chest pain**
  - **Flat or Down ST_Slope**
- Classified as **“Red Zone”** (Highest Priority)

### Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)
- Integrate the **SVM model** into hospital systems
- Estimated **20% improvement** in diagnostic efficiency

### Preventive Intervention
- Automatic clinical alert for patients with:
  - **Predicted risk probability > 0.7**
- Enables early preventive and therapeutic actions
